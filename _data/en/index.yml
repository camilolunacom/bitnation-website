Bitnation started in July 2014 and hosted the world’s first blockchain marriage, birth certificate, refugee emergency ID, World Citizenship, DBVN Constitution and more. The website proof-of-concept, including the blockchain ID and Public Notary, is used by tens of thousands of Bitnation Citizens and Embassies around the world. Bitnation is the winner of UNESCO’s Netexplo Award 2017, and has been featured by the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, BBC, CNN, WIRED, VICE, TechCrunch, The Economist, Russia Today among many others."
28: "Pangea Arbitration Token (PAT)"
29: "The Pangea Arbitration Token (PAT) is an ERC20 compatible in-app token for the Pangea Jurisdiction. The PAT token is proof-of-reputation for Citizens, issued when Citizens create a contract, successfully complete a contract or resolve a dispute attached to a contract. PAT is an algorithmic reputation token; an arbitration currency based on performance, rather than purchasing power, popularity, or attention."

35: "Secure and Transparent"
36: "PAT is an ERC20 (Ethereum based) industry-standard token, easily
integrated with wallets and exchanges. PAT code, the DBVN Multisignature
code, and the Bitnation TSE Contract code has all been designed and
audited by leading Solidity experts. All contracts are open source and
can be found on our GitHub. Funds are secured by Bitcoin Suisse AG in a
multisignature wallet."
37: "Hard Capped"
38: "The PAT TSE will raise funds for Pangea development and to power
Bitnation’s ecosystem. 34% of PAT will be sold during the TSE, including
a pre-sale. To ensure the token is not diluted, the TSE is hard capped
at US $30 million. This is designed to increase PAT token value as
Pangea evolves and gains market adoption."
39: "Powers Pangea"
40: "More than a third of PAT is reserved to power the Pangea Jurisdiction.
Citizens garner non-tradable reputation tokens based on successful
contract execution. Arbitrators and contracts also accumulate
non-tradable tokens. Citizens are rewarded with PAT for accumulating
non-tradable reputation tokens when milestones are reached."
