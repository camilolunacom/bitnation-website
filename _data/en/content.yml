Governance technologies will have a greater long-term positive impact on the lives of billions of people than any of the other Web 3.0 solution currently being developed. Bitnation is the pioneer and most well established project in decentralised Gov.Tech.: "Governance technologies will have a greater long-term positive impact on the lives of billions of people than any of the other Web 3.0 solution currently being developed.

Over three billion people worldwide have little or no access to governance services or legal protections. Either because they are part of the global System D informal economy; because they reside in predatory juridictions which censure their identity or way of life through corrupt legal instruments, extortion or coercion; or because they are stateless or refugees.  In addition, many millions - soon to be billions - more also participate in a global economy where their work and social interactions cross the boundaries of current geographic jurisdictions.: "Over three billion people worldwide have little or no access to governance services or legal protections.

All of these people would benefit from tailor-made borderless jurisdictions which provide protections for their lives and livelihoods. The US$6 billion global legal services industry barely reaches this market and is ripe for disruption.: "All of these people would benefit from tailor-made borderless jurisdictions which provide protections for their lives and livelihoods.

Founded in 2014 by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Bitnation is developing Pangea - a easy to use, smartphone-based and chat-driven polylegal jurisdiction for world citizens and those excluded from legal protection. Pangea delivers this through a marketplace of community building, governance services, arbitration services and the development of smart contracts.: "Founded in 2014 by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Bitnation is developing Pangea - a easy to use, smartphone-based and chat-driven polylegal jurisdiction for world citizens and those excluded from legal protection.

Pangea's mobile-chat frontend is built upon Panthalassa, our native in-house developed, encrypted and quantum resistant mesh communications network. Panthalassa is not a blockchain, it is a decentralised communications network and can write smart contracts to any integrated blockchain - allowing Pangea users to select the blockchain of their choice to run their smart contracts.  Initially Pangea integrated with the Ethereum blockchain - others will follow.: "Pangea’s mobile-chat frontend is built upon Panthalassa, our native in-house developed, encrypted and quantum resistant mesh communications network.

Pangea’s core governance infrastructure is currently in its third iteration. A frontend demo built on a functional version of Panthalassa is available to download.
